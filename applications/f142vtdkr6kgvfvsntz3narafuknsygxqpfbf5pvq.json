    "Brief history of your project and organization": "As a data preparer, I am very optimistic about the storage value of filecoin, and I have a lot of experience with data cutting and distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) is a NASA funded project made to collect and archive a variety of scientific data to support the astronomical community. The data housed in MAST includes science and engineering data, with a primary focus on data sets in the optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared parts of the spectrum, from over 20 space-based missions. MAST offers single mission-based queries as well as cross-mission queries. Astroqueryâ€™s astroquery.mast module is one tool used to query and access the data in this Archive.\r\n\r\nastroquery.mast offers 3 main services: MastClass, CatalogsClass, and Cutouts. MastClass allows direct programatic access to the MAST Portal. Along with ObservationsClass, it is used to query MAST observational data. The Catalogs class is used to query MAST catalog data. The available catalogs include the Pan-STARRS and Hubble Source catalogs along with a few others listed under the Catalog Queries section of this page. Lastly, Cutouts, a newer addition to astroquery.mast, provides access to full-frame image cutouts of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), MAST Hubble Advanced Product (HAP),and deep-field images, through TesscutClass, HapcutClass, and ZcutClass respectively.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",

    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe, Australia (continent)",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02837684\r\nf03028412\r\nf02948257\r\nf01877259\r\nf02812307\r\nf02815451\r\nf02815448\r\nf02944782\r\nf02888899\r\nf02953066\r\nf02956073",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
