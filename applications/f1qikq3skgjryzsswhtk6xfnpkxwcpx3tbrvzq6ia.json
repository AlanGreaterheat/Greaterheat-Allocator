    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Starboard Ventures is an integral part of the Filecoin ecosystem, responsible for providing vital network analytics through our Network Health Dashboard (dashboard.starboard.ventures). The intent of this project is to onboard historical Filecoin data on Filecoin itself. The project serves two purposes: First, as a service to the Filecoin ecosystem (allowing the public to access historical data without incurring expensive extraction cost). Second, as a powerful demonstration of Filecoin's capabilities and a proof-of-concept for other blockchains.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Historical data of Filecoin as extracted from Lily. For schema, see https://lilium.sh",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "The data is prepared using Lily, a wrapped Lotus node, which processes raw blockchain data into structured datasets. For details of the tooling used, see lilium.sh.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "1. GCP open dataset: https://lily.starboard.ventures/data/dumps/#gcp-bigquery\r\n2. Sample: https://gist.github.com/Terryhung/0fc221823d950af75ff8b379d3f039dc\r\n\r\n\r\ns3://mwapublic/uvfits/4.1\r\ns3://mwapublic/uvfits/5.1",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[ ] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Daily",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "I don't know yet",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "Not sure yet",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
